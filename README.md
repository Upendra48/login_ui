# Login UI Design

This is a simple Flutter application showcasing a basic login page with minimal functionality.

## Description

The application demonstrates a login screen with:

- Username and password fields.
- "Forgot Password?" link.
- "Create Account" link to navigate to a sign-up page.

It uses basic UI elements such as `TextField`, `MaterialButton`, and animations from the `animate_do` package.

## Features

- User login using provided username and password.
- Password recovery via "Forgot Password?" link.
- Navigation to the sign-up page using the "Create Account" link.

## Installation

To run this application:

1. Ensure you have Flutter installed.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Run `flutter pub get` to install the required dependencies.
4. Connect a device or use an emulator.
5. Run `flutter run` in the project directory.

## Usage

- The login button currently does not have authentication logic.
- The "Forgot Password?" and "Create Account" links don't navigate to specific pages.

## Roadmap

Future updates might include:

- Implementing authentication logic.
- Adding functionality to the "Forgot Password?" link.
- Creating the sign-up page and its related functionality.


## Acknowledgements

- This project uses the `animate_do` package for animations.
